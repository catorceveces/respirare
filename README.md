# Respirare

Ultra minimal Jekyll theme that focuses on content. Respirare it is 100% responsive, that means it fits with all different kind of devices in different sizes.

**Less is more**. The default page shows the last blog post. And the about section shows a mini bio and all the posts titles. For each post **only**  one tag.

You can see a demo on [my own blog](http://catorceveces.github.io). (Note that some navigation config are different).
